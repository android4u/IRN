How to run this application
==========================

The ideal way is to have a apache.conf file (as in this folder) and link it
with you main apache2.conf file. In your /etc/apache2/apache.conf file
put this line:
* Include "/home/sanket/irn-hacku/apache.conf" -- this is for me

Next you need to configure the local apache.conf file, there is a directory location. Just change it to wherever your source is, ex:
* Alias "/home/sanket/irn-hacku/src/"

To set the config right, just do this:

* sudo service apache2 restart

Your code should be available at:

* http://localhost/irn/

Just make sure your browser has proxy disabled
